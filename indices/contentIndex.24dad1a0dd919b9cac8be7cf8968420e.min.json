Unlike the EFE, however, the FEEF also possesses a strong naturalistic grounding as a bound on a theoretically relevant quantity. ==The FEEF can maintain both its information-maximizing imperative and its theoretical grounding since it is derived from the minimization of a KL divergence rather than the maximization of a log model evidence==. ‚Äî [@Millidge2020c](notes/6-Citation-notes/@Millidge2020c.md)\n\n\u003e The key difference with the EFE lies in the likelihood term. ==While the EFE simply tries to maximize the expected evidence of the desired observations, the FEEF minimizes the KL divergence between the likelihood of observations predicted under the veridical generative model and the marginal likelihood of observations under the biased generative model==.\n\u003e [...] The extrinsic value term thus encourages the agent to choose its actions such that its predictions over states lead to observations which are close to its preferred observations, while also trying move to states whereby the entropy over observations is maximized, thus leading the agent to move towards states where the generative model is not as certain about the likely outcome. ==In effect, the FEEF possesses another exploratory term, in addition to the information gain, which the EFE lacks==.  ‚Äî [@Millidge2020c](notes/6-Citation-notes/@Millidge2020c.md)\n\n\u003e Another important advantage is that ==the FEEF it is mathematically equivalent to the VFE (with a biased generative model) in the present time with a current observation==. [...] This means that theoretically we can consider an agent to be both inferring and planning using the same objective, which is not true of the EFE. *The EFE does not reduce to the VFE when observations are known, and thus requires a separate objective function to be minimized for planning compared to inference*. Because of this, it is actually possible to argue that FEEF is mandated by the free-energy principle. ==On this view there is no distinction between present and future inference and both follow from minimizing the same objective but under different informational constraints==.  ‚Äî [@Millidge2020c](notes/6-Citation-notes/@Millidge2020c.md)\n\n---\n\n## Definitions\n\n**VFE** : *Instantaneous Free energy*\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{F} \u0026=\\mathbf{D} _ {K L}\\left[Q\\left(x _ {t} \\mid o _ {t} ; \\phi\\right) \\| p\\left(o _ {t}, x _ {t}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n\u0026=\\mathbb{E} _ {Q\\left(x _ {t} \\mid o _ {t} ; \\phi\\right)}\\left[\\ln \\frac{Q\\left(x _ {t} \\mid o _ {t} ; \\phi\\right)}{p\\left(o _ {t}, x _ {t}\\right)}\\right] \\\\\n\u0026=-\\underbrace{\\mathbb{E} _ {Q\\left(x _ {t} \\mid o _ {t} ; \\phi\\right)}\\left[\\ln p\\left(o _ {t} \\mid x _ {t}\\right)\\right]} _ {\\text {Accuracy }}+\\underbrace{\\mathbf{D} _ {K L}\\left[Q\\left(x _ {t} \\mid o _ {t} ; \\phi\\right)|| p\\left(x _ {t}\\right)\\right]} _ {\\text {Complexity }}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n**EFE**: *Expected free energy*\n**AIF**: *Active inference*.
